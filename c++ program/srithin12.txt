C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980.
C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s).
C++ is so compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code.
